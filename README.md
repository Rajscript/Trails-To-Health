# Trails To Health
Last year me and a couple of my close friends decided we wanted to start some fitness routine to boost our physical and mental wellbeing. But we didnâ€™t know where to start. Since it can be intimidating to join the gym, I suggested that we go for a hike. But that brought a new problem at hand. We chose a nearby state park called Green Lake, but when we got there, we were not sure which trail to take. We spent a good 15 minutes figuring out which trail to take by looking at each of the trails on google map and the state park website before we could decide on one. 
This small incident put the idea in my mind about my current project on a recommendation system that will recommend trails that suit your needs without the headache of doing your own research especially for a beginner health enthusiast.

Trails to Health is a web application that recommends hiking trails based on user preferences such as location, transport mode, elevation gain, trail length, experience level, and distance. The application can also recommend trails solely on difficulty level.
